# controller-aos-web-html

This controller scenario shows four groups from four cities and uses network virtualization to highlight different speeds. 

This sceanrio requires the vugen-aos-web-html script for use in the four groups.

The scenario runs and the slower cities typically display timeout connection errors. An SLA is also defined which should show that the scenario does not meet the 90th percentile transaction time of 13 seconds.
